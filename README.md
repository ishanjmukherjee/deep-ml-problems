# deep-ml problems
These are my solutions to coding challenges from [deep-ml.com](https://www.deep-ml.com). It has a relatively small at the moment, but cool collection of problems -- I recommend checking it out! Other resources in this vein include:
- [TensorGym](https://tensorgym.com/exercises)
- Sasha Rush's [Tensor Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles)
- Nicolas Rougier's [100 numpy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100) (and his book, [From Python to Numpy](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy))
